# Nerts

Nerts is an Android card game I wrote in early 2012. It was one of my first
Java projects and actually became a usable, playable game.

It's not quite true to the real game, which allows continuous play
by all players, and it's fairly difficult to win which can be frustrating.
Nevertheless it's playable, and if you like tinkering, there's plenty of
room for improvement.

Good luck, have fun.
